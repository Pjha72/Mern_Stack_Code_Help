# What is Network?
### A network refers to a group or system of interconnected entities or nodes that communicate and exchange information or resources. These entities can be computers, servers, routers, switches, and other network devices.

# What are the types of Network?
### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)
### 2. Wide Area Network (WAN)
### 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
### 4. Wireless LAN (WLAN)
### 5. Storage Area Network (SAN)
### 6. Virtual Private Network (VPN)
### 7. Cloud Network
### 8. Peer-to-peer Network (P2P)
### 9. Client-server Network

# What is LAN,MAN,WAN?
### There are several types of networks, and they can be classified based on their size, geographic scope, and the technology they use to transmit data. Here are some common types of networks:

### 1. Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN connects devices within a small geographic area, such as an office building or a campus. It typically uses Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi to transmit data.

### 2. Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN connects devices across a larger geographic area, often spanning multiple cities or countries. It uses technologies such as leased lines, satellite links, or the Internet to transmit data.

### 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN connects devices within a city or a metropolitan area. It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

### 4. Wireless LAN (WLAN): A WLAN uses Wi-Fi to connect devices within a small geographic area without the need for cables.

### 5. Storage Area Network (SAN): A SAN is a specialized network that provides access to shared storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries.

### 6. Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN enables secure communication over a public network such as the Internet by encrypting data and creating a secure tunnel between devices.

### 7. Cloud Network: A cloud network is a virtual network that operates on top of a public or private cloud infrastructure, enabling users to access cloud resources and services from anywhere in the world.

### 8. Peer-to-peer Network (P2P): A P2P network allows devices to communicate and share resources with each other without the need for a central server.

### 9. Client-server Network: A client-server network consists of clients that request resources or services from a central server that manages and provides these resources or services.

# What is IP Addesss?
### An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as a unique identifier for the device and allows it to communicate with other devices on the network.

# What is WWW?
### WWW stands for World Wide Web, which is a system of interconnected hypertext documents that are accessed through the internet
### The World Wide Web is a network of web pages that are linked together through hyperlinks, which are clickable links that allow users to navigate between web pages. These web pages can contain various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements.
### To access the World Wide Web, you need a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. You can then enter a website address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the web browser's address bar to access a particular web page.
### The World Wide Web has revolutionized the way we access and share information, enabling people all over the world to easily and quickly access a vast amount of knowledge and resources. It has also paved the way for e-commerce, social networking, and other forms of online communication and collaboration.

# What is Client-Server Model?
### The client-server model is a computing architecture that divides computing tasks between two types of entities: clients and servers. In this model, the client is a program or device that requests services or resources from the server, and the server is a program or device that provides these services or resources in response to client requests.
### The client-server model is used in many types of computing environments, from small local networks to large-scale internet-based systems. Some common examples of client-server applications include web browsing, email, online gaming, and file sharing.
### The client and server communicate with each other over a network using a communication protocol such as TCP/IP. The client sends requests to the server, which processes them and sends back a response. This process is repeated for each request and response.


# What is Internet?
### The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and other devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange information and data. It is a decentralized, distributed network that spans the globe, connecting billions of devices and users together.
### To access the internet, you need a device such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet, as well as an internet connection provided by an internet service provider (ISP). You can then use various applications and services to connect with other users and devices on the internet, such as email, social media, online shopping, video conferencing, and more.
### While the internet has many benefits, it also poses some risks and challenges, such as security threats, privacy concerns, and the spread of misinformation. As a result, it is important to use the internet responsibly and take steps to protect your personal information and online activities.
