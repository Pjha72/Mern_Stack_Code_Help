# How the Internet Works 

# What is internet?
:)) Inter => Interconnected  , net => Network 
:)) Network of Networks 

### DNS :  Domain Name System : can convert the request into IP address
### IP : Internet Protocol 
# Client-Server Model 
:)) client send different types request i.e get,put,post,delete to server after some preprocessing step 
server can send response to the client.

# ISP : Internet Service Provider 

## Packets : Data can be divided into small small chunks or units that unit/chunks is called packets 
# Protocol Stack : 
### 1 Application layer : protocol can be used for specific application
### 2 TCP layer : This layer can give me the PORT no
### 3 IP Layer : Add IP address of Destination machine  
### 4 Hardware

# Protocol : set of rules 
### HTTP : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 
### FTP : File Transfer Protocol 
### SMTP : Simple mail transfer protocol 

### Gmail can use SMTP Protocol : simple mail transfer protocol 

## Router : Connect Multiple Network

# TCP/IP Model
# OSI Model
###  Physical Layer 
### Data Layer 
### Network Layer 
### Transport Layer 
### Session Layer 
### Persentation Layer 
### Application Layer 

## H.W : Write a command for print the ip address of www.google.com 
### Sol : To print the IP Address of the google.com you can use the command "nslookup" in a terminal or command prompt 
### nslookup www.google.com , This command will query the DNS server and return IP Address associated with the hostname "www.google.com".
## H.W : Describe IP Address i.e IPv4 IPv6
### An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication.
### IP address are typically repersented as a series of four numbers separted by dots, such as 192.168.0.1. Each of four numbers can range from 0 to 255.
### IPv4 : It is the older and more widely used protocol, but it has limitations in the number of available addressess.
### IPv6 : It provides a much larger address space and is designed to address the limitations of IPv4.
